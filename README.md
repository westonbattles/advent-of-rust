## Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of daily coding challenges, created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). It's a fun and engaging way to improve coding skills and tackle interesting problems.

<br>


## About This Repository
In an effort to refine my practical skill with the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), I have taken on the challenge of solving the Advent of Code 2023 challenges using Rust. This repository is a documentation of my journey, showcasing my solutions and the thought processes behind them.

<br>

## Why Rust?
Rust is known for its performance, memory safety and concurrency. By using Rust, I aim to not just solve the problems at hand, but explore these features of Rust and understand how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

<br>

## Repository Structure
Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific day of the Advent of Code. Inside each directory, you will find:
- The problem statement for the day
- My solution written in Rust
- A brief explanation of my approach and any challenges I encountered
- Any additional resources or references I found helpful

<br>

### Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I aim to:
- Deepen my understanding of Rust and its idiomatic practices.
- Improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.
- Share my solutions with the community and learn from others' approaches.

### Contributing
While this is primarily a personal learning project, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and discussions. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have ideas on how to improve the solutions or the repository in general.

### Acknowledgements
A big thank you to Eric Wastl for creating such an engaging and educational set of challenges. And to the Rust community for their invaluable resources and support.
