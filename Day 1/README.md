# Day 1

Day 1 started off pretty simple, and proved to be extremly applicable to Rust's powerful parseing capabilities: Given each line in some input file, you must sum the number created by the first numeric and last numeric.

For exmaple if the given input file read:
```
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```
The answer would be 12 + 38 + 15 + 77 which is 142
